<h3>About KaNaPi</h3>

It's a free, educational operating system based on Linux created from scratch.
<br>KaNaPi is distributed as build system, which allows you to build your own operating system.

<h4>KaNaPi KS</h4>

The new version of KaNaPi, allows you to create packages (above 530 at this moment) for 3 architectures x86, x86_64 and arm.
Recently main focus switched to x86_64 architecture only.
<br>The build system contains dependencies, so you can create the whole Linux by running only few commands.
<br>Sources are downloaded automatically and then built.  
<br>There are also binary drops available on Source Forge for x86/x86_64, wm8650, Raspberry Pi for tests.
